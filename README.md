# java repository patren starter

This Java starter project is a simple template that integrates Lombok, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL to demonstrate how to insert data into a single table called user. It uses Lombok to reduce boilerplate code such as getters and setters, while Hibernate provides object-relational mapping to simplify database operations. PostgreSQL serves as the backend database, and the project is designed to be lightweight and focused, with only the insert functionality implemented. This setup is ideal for beginners or as a base for further development involving user data management.
